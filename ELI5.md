# Explain Like I'm Five

## What is a ticker?
A ticker is a short nickname for a specific commodity or stock. Instead of saying “West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil,” traders say `CL=F`. It keeps conversations fast and precise.

## Why watch prices all day?
Commodity traders buy and sell energy and metals. Prices wiggle constantly like a bouncing ball. Watching those wiggles helps them react quickly when the market jumps or dips.

## What is a moving average?
Imagine drawing a line that smooths out the bouncy price ball by looking at the average of the last few days. A **20-day moving average** looks at the last 20 days and shows the overall direction. It’s like seeing the path of the ball instead of each tiny bounce.

## What is a daily percent change?
If a barrel of oil cost $80 yesterday and $84 today, it moved up by $4. Divide that $4 by $80 to get 0.05, or **5%**. Traders care about percent moves because it tells them how big the jump feels compared to the price itself.

## Why build a dashboard?
Traders need one place to glance and understand:
- “What’s the latest price?”
- “Is today’s move big or small?”
- “Are we above or below the usual trend?”

The dashboard is like a smart scoreboard with graphs and alerts that say, “Hey, this move is unusual—pay attention!”

## How do alerts help?
You can set a threshold, like “Tell me if the price moves more than 3% today.” The dashboard flashes a warning, so even if you are looking at something else, you know it is time to check the market.
